# matchr
Connections made easy

matchr uses firebase to authenticate users and store questions.
Much like google forms, it is customizable, supporting any workflow
using single selection (radio) and multi selection (checkbox).

Both sending responses and receiving questions are done in realtime,
allowing matchr to change its form instantly. The questions and comparisons
are also decoupled from the UI, so no rebuilds are necessary to switch between forms.

matchr makes it easy to make the connections you need, all from a beautified apk.
